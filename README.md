Tool to export firefly budget amounts

Somehow firefly doesn't have a view to see the monthly amount added to the budgets...
But it has an API with these information. :)

I took this opportunity to start a fresh phoenix project and close some gaps in my live view knowledge.

it's no big deed, but a neat little live view example or at least the kind of live view I came up with ^^

You will need a firefly installation
